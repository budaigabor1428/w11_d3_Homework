1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
It is used to assign a line/chunk of code for debugging in an application. The code will run but when it reaches the breakpoint the debugging console will be opened. We can put it in the test or in the class on any line of code.

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
No.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?
We can use the step-over button.

4. What does the step into command do?
It switches into the method that is debugged at the moment and pauses at the top of the method.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment? 
With evaluate expressions we can evaluate and run Java code (we can evaluate the result of certain methods). If we want to run multiple methods or multiple lines of code we can use the code fragment mode. Here we can create and assign variables as well.
